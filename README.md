This is my new portfolio, but I'm currently re-doing it. I'm about to finish UCLA Coding BootCamp in about a month. I'm in the middle of the final project, and need to fix some bugs from the last project I made before I can add it to my portfolio. This is just a basic single page application with no javascript. I will be expaning and adding javscript as I continue to learn on my own. I am looking for work, feel free to contact me with any questions.
