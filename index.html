                        <h3>Getting Started in Cyber Security</h3>
                        <br>

												When I was looking for work as web developer I started
												finding more scammers	then clients. I quickly learned 
												I needed to protect myself better online and
												the sites I was building. So when I attended SCALE for the first time in
												2018 I focused on the security panels. They not only
												taught how to keep myself safer online but also to keep
												my personal information more secure. I also learned how
												to make sites I built safer and started finding meetups
												for cyber security. I finally found the area I wanted to
												focus on with my programming. I could continue using my
												knowledge from web development in a new way. I
												eventually attended an open house for a local tech
												company, and that is where I learned about bug bounty
												programs. I ended up focusing all my time on learning
												about bug hunting.</p>
                        <p class='indent'>I had made some friends in cyber
												security so I reached out to them to see if they knew
												where to start learning about bug hunting. They gave me
												some great resources like Hacker1 and BugCrowd where I
												found more info and resources. I started reading every
												book and watching every youtube video I could find on the
												subject. I also started implementing everything I
												learned to my own life and trying out bug hunting. I had
												already received great advice like using a password
												manager, setting up to monitor accounts for any
												transaction and login, and to lie for security
												questions. All this has not only helped me feel more
												secure but actually saved me from bigger problems. You can't
												prevent data breaches but you can ensure it does as
												little damage as possible by knowing as soon as
												possible about it. It has been fun learning how people
												find and exploit vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p class='indent'>I started out learning about OWASP's
												top ten, and practicing on various capture the flag
												virtual machines. I also started making my own pen test cheat
												sheets based on the successful payloads from practicing
												on purposely vulnerable sites and then running those on
												real bug bounty programs. I still have a lot to learn,
											  but that is the best part. One of my favorite moments so
												far	was learning how to steel a cookie with XSS while
												netcat was set to listen for the GET request when pop ups were 
												being blocked. That was fun! Well off to learn and test,
												TTFN.</p>
