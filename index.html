			    <h3>Hand Pain and Touch Typing</h3>
			    <br>
			    <time datetime="12-20-2017">

			    <p class="indent">Earlier in the fall I ran into a problem where my hands cramped up and I was unable to move them. I was unable to type for several days and I started getting behind on my internship and personal projects.  I was in screaming pain, and it seemed like there was nothing I could do, so I looked into voice to text software.  However, most of them are not compatible with Linux, the operating system I use. I know one brand has a plug in, but the other part of the problem is that these programs are not designed for a coder.  They are meant for office programs like Word, but there are libraries you can load in and train it to work.  When I reached out to see if my brother, a computer engineer, knew of anything that I was not finding online he sent me a video of someone who managed to get the voice to text to work.</p>
			    <br>
			    <p class="indent">This video was a few years old but he was able to hack into some software and reprogram it to work in different programming languages.  He was able to make his own library of commands of what seem like random sounds that shorthand the punctuation needed for coding.  He also mentioned that while this helped with the pain he had while typing it also caused him to get a sore throat from talking all day. So while voice to text may save your hands it takes a tool on your voice.  After learning more about what he did, and realizing it not only meant needing to be a more advanced programmer to accomplish but I still couldn't type.  It was days of being unable to use my hands at all to only being able to use them for short periods of time. This meant that as a junior developer it was going to take too long to get to that point.  So I had to move on to the other suggestions from my brother.</p>
			    <br>
			    <p class="indent">He had also started a similar journey back in the spring, but not because he was in pain.  He was simply trying form better typing habits to avoid potential problems later.  He also wrote a blog on his website about it, <a href="http://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/04/01/">Null Program Typing Blog</a>, and sent me the link.  I took the time I needed to let my hands rest and heal, and getting a trigger point massage helped.  I found a great massage therapsit who worked on releasing all the knots and toxins in my forarms.  She is very experienced and has helped countless people who work on computers all day with the same pain I was experiencing.  I then started using the typingclub.com site my brother recommended to learn touch typing, and over time was able to not only type for longer periods of time with less pain, but also become a much faster typist.  Touch typing is basically keeping your hands on the home row of the keyboard and using specific fingers to reach all the different keys all while never looking down at the keyboard.  This also helps to keep good posture which is a key detial in preventing pain.   A few other pieces of advice is taking a break every hour to get up and move, every 15 minutes or so stretching out your arms, and regular exercise.</p>
			    <br>
			    <p class="indent">After learning new typing habits I ran into the same problem my brother did, Emacs shortcuts do not work with touch typing and break all the good habits I was trying to build up. So I looked into modal editing and switching to vi/vim which has it built in.  Modal editing is simply a way of changing the keyboard mode from editing mode to command mode.  This allows the same keys you already keep your hands at, the home row, to navigate around the file.  It is a little weird at fist and takes some practice, but has really helped so I can type longer and faster.  I would also suggest typing up a file you don't care about to learn the commands because I have accidentally deleted lines in the process of learning modal editing and vi/vim.</p>  
			    <br>
			    <p class="indent">I still have pain, and honestly any job where you have repetative movements like typing will wreak havon on those muscles.  I have spent the last few months not only learning touch typing and modal editing but also working with a physical therapist on my posture.  She has given me exercises to help me build the muscles I use to keep good posture, as well as suggested I use a pinky ball or tennis ball to massage my forarms and back myself. This is a cheap and easy way to help keep the pain at tolerable levels, and even go days without problems.  At the end of the day good posture, regular breaks, strecthing, self massage, and finding the right proffessionals, i.e. massage therapust, physical therapist, to help find weak spots all work together to keep me functioning.  It has been a long journey with lots of bumps, but has drastically improved my life. I highly suggest that you developed these good habits before you get injured or have problems.  It is not always the repetative movements that can cause these problems, the man who hacked the voice to text software injured his shoulder in a rock climbing accident that caused all his problems with typing.  I have back prblems from car accidents I was in 10 years ago that still cause me pain and have contributed to my typing problems.  You never know what life will throw at you, but one thing I learned is having good posture and stretching will always help prevent pain from repetative motions or injury.</p>

			    <h3>Hybrid Polymer Element Bower.json</h3>
			    <br>
			    <time datetime="09-2-2017">

			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <p class="indent">So this week I am working on an open source Polymer Element, proplanr-repeat, to set up a repeating action/appointment.  It has taken some trial and error since I am new to Polymer, and it will be set up to save either to Firebase or your preferred database. The docs for Polymer are helpful, but they were missing some key elements to create a bower.json that will install both Polymer 1 and Polymer 2 dependencies in separate folders.  After looking at elements that other people have created I was able to find what I was missing.  The first thing is you need to add the proper version type at the end of the dependency in the bower.json file, #1 - 2.</p>
			    <br>
			    <pre><code>"dependencies": {
    "paper-styles": "PolymerElements/paper-styles#1 - 2",
    "polymer": "Polymer/polymer#1.9 - 2",
    "paper-input": "PolymerElements/paper-input#1 - 2",
    "paper-button": "PolymerElements/paper-button#1 - 2",
    "paper-dropdown-menu": "PolymerElements/paper-dropdown-menu#1 - 2",
    "paper-item": "PolymerElements/paper-item#1 - 2",
    "paper-listbox": "PolymerElements/paper-listbox#1 - 2",
    "paper-checkbox": "PolymerElements/paper-checkbox#1 - 2",
    "vaadin-date-picker": "vaadin/vaadin-date-picker#^2.0.5",
    "iron-form": "PolymerElements/iron-form#1 - 2"
  },</code></pre>
			    <br>
			    
			    <p class="indent">The big part I was missing hat they failed to explain in the docs was that you also had to add all the dependencies to the variant 1.x, with a different version specified. The version you need is the one compatible with Polymer 1, and usually you can find it in the docs for that element.  For most of the PolymerElements it is as simple as using, #^1.x.x.</p>
			    <br>
			    <pre><code>"variants": {
    "1.x": {
      "dependencies": {
        "polymer": "Polymer/polymer#^1.9",
        "paper-styles": "PolymerElements/paper-styles#^1.0.0",
        "paper-input": "PolymerElements/paper-input#^1.0.2",
        "paper-button": "PolymerElements/paper-button#^1.0.0",
        "paper-dropdown-menu": "PolymerElements/paper-dropdown-menu#^1.0.0",
        "paper-item": "PolymerElements/paper-item#^1.0.0",
        "paper-listbox": "PolymerElements/paper-listbox#^1.0.0",
        "paper-checkbox": "PolymerElements/paper-checkbox#^1.0.1",
        "vaadin-date-picker": "vaadin/vaadin-date-picker#^1.0.5",
        "iron-form": "PolymerElements/iron-form#^1.0.1"
      },</code></pre>
			    <br>
			    
			    <p class="indent">Once I had the bower.json set-up properly I was able to run polymer install --variants and it installed both versions. In the root directory you will find both bower_components and bower_components-1.x, as well as a new bower.json created called bower-1.x.json. Then I ran polymer serve which allowed me to run the demo and test out both versions on a browser.  The next step will be incorporating the functionality to save the user input to a database and create the actions/appointments in the database as well.</p>
