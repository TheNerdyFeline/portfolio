	  <a href="./marvel-app/index.html" target="_blank" class="title"><h3>Herolution</h3></a>
	  <p class="indent">This project was my first group programming project, and we chose a passion project based on Marvel.  We thought it would be great to help people be heroes in their own community.  This app allows a user to search for places to volunteer as well as find registered heroes from the movies.  We did not stop there, because what superhero is complete without a sidekick. We also wanted people to rescue animals as their sidekicks.  I built the main page html, and the javascript for it. You can checkout the app by clicking the link above or you can checkout the code at github, <a href="https://github.com/TheNerdyFeline/marvel-app" title="marvel=app" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="project">
	  <a href="https://sequelizeburger1000.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" class="title"><h3>Burger! Burger! Burger!</h3></a>
	  <p class="indent">This was a simple full stack web app that allows a user to name and order a burger, then devour it.  This was one of the first projects I built a server for as well as creatd a mySQL database and used seuqelize to change the data in the database. I also launched it on heroku where you can use the app. It was a fun homework assignment.  You can checkout the app by clicking the link above or you can checkout the code at github, <a href="https://github.com/TheNerdyFeline/HW-Sequelize-burger" title="LIRI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="project">
	  <a href="https://thenerdyfeline.github.io/HW-triviaGame/" target="_blank" class="title"><h3>Trivia Game</h3></a>
	  <p class="indent">This is one of the first games I made in school, and it is where I started building separated algorithms for the different functions. This is where I found I really enjoy making games, and really had fun with it.  I made the trivia questions in a separate javascript file so that you can easily change the trivia game to any category, right now it is Disney trivia.  You can checkout the app by clicking the link above or you can checkout the code at github, <a href="https://github.com/TheNerdyFeline/HW-triviaGame" title="trivia" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
