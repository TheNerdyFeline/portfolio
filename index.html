   <p id='bio'>Hi, my name is Jackie and I am the nerdy feline.  I am just getting my feet wet in programming.  I am a sound designer switching careers and looking for new opportunities. I will be posting about current projects and all the fun things I am learning about... python, html/css, javascript, java, c, raspberry pi, and anything else that sounds interesting. If you would like to take a closer look at any of the code used, you can checkout my repos on <a href='https://www.github.com/thenerdyfeline' title='thenerdyfeline'>Github</a>.</p>

   <h2>My First Website</h2>
   <p class='indent'>Hi Everyone! Welcome to my first website.  I was able to take an intro to html/css class, and I took what I learned to build this website.  For those of you also new to programming, it is what all websites are coded with.  Although some wrap it up a bow for you to just drag and drop everything into place, but I don't always like the way they work. </p>
   <p class='indent'>When making an html you will need a text editor, such as sublime, which will allow you to save the file as index.html, and a style sheet saves as style.css.  The end .html and .css is the most important part, because it tells the computer the type of file it is reading.  HTML stands for Hyper-Text Mark-up Language, and CSS stands for Cascading Style ¬Sheet.  The more important one to remember is what css stands for, because it is how the computer reads and changes your website.  The computer reads the sheet top to bottom, applying each change as it goes. There are many different ways to use css to select and adjust each piece, and a great way to learn is through a game, <a href='http://flukeout.github.io/' title='css game'>Css Game.</a>.</p>
   <p class='indent'>There are many great resources for learning the basic setup, and it is one of the simplest languages to learn.  I have found it is a great place to start programming, and you can search online for just about any error message or problem.  Another great way to learn is to take classes, but I understand you may not want to commit to a full boot camp, so sites like meetup.com can allow you to find groups that offer 1 or 2 day classes.   There are also some amazing sites that offer free classes online such as <a href=’https://www.freecodecamp.com’ title=’freecodecamp’>freecodecamp.com</a> and <a href=’https://www.codeacademy.com’ title=’codeacademy’>codeacademy.com</a>.  Good luck and be sure to check back for more projects! </p>
