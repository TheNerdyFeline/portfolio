	    <p class="indent">I am The Nerdy Feline, a nerd who loves cats, and a full stack web developer.  I was a sound designer for 6 years, but it was not challenging enough, and I had always wanted to learn to code.  I started taking some classes, most of them were 1 day classes, intro to html/css, javscript, python, anything I could find.</p>
	    <p class="indent">I loved playing around with javascript and python, and was inspired to go back to school.  I found a great 6 month program at UCLA, and enjoyed working on most of the homework assignements.  I have fun working on a projects where I get to be creative and learn new things everyday.  You will find some of my favorite projects listed below, and if you click the title you can check them out. You can also see the code for all projects on my github at, <a href="https://github.com/TheNerdyFeline">thenerdyfeline</a>. I am currently looking for work and/or my next project.</p>
	    <p class="indent">I also love to cook, bake, garden, swim, and have 4 wonderful cats. Since moving to LA I have been inspired to eat and live healthier so I can be happy and healthy. Something else I had always wanted to learn was cooking, so I took some cooking classes.  At the end of a fun day of coding, I relish in a cooking a healthy delicious meal. I live in Glendale, CA and am always looking for new adventures and new things to learn in coding and cooking.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
