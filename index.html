	  <h3>First Week of Coding Boot Camp</h3>

	  <p class="indent"> Hi Everyone! I know it has been a while since I posted a project, but I realized that before I can really get into programming any language I need a better foundation of basic computer skills and teachers I can ask for help. So I signed up for UCLA Extentiosn Coding Boot Camp, and I just finished my first week.  It is a 6 month program, and as I go through I will be adding more projects to my online portfolio. However I have been prepping this whole time on getting some basic computer skills.</p>
	  <p class="indent">I have been learning command line and Emacs, my chosen text editor. I highly recommend if you want to learn to program you start with command line, your best friend and picking a nice text editor.  On the first day they did go over some baic command line commands, but it was nice I already knew my way around, like the short cut to move the cursor to the beginning of the line, Ctl-a. I also found it was helpful to pick a good text editor.  I have really enjoyed learning and playing in Emacs.</p>
	  <p class="indent">With Emacs it is a bit more complicated then sublime, but both are great text editors.  They come with some amazing tools that can help you debug, and test your code.  One thing that was missing from the book I read on Emacs is if I want to see the changes I made to my init file I had to evaluate the line I just inserted. So reading mutiple books, and having a mentor you can ask questions can be really helpful when you come across missing information, as well as Google. In boot camp they call that Google fu, because searching online is going to be your other best friend. Getting these basic skills down really helped me be better prepared so I can concentrate on just learning the concepts of computer languages. I can't wait to see what I learn next.</p>

	  <h3>Python and LED Fun</h3>

    <p class='indent'>Hi Everyone! I have been playing with python, and I was able to make this awesome program to turn LED's on and off on my raspberry pi 2.  If you don't know much about Raspberry pi, it is a very small computer that is just as powerful as a desktop, and the current one is 3.  You will see it in a clear box in the back of the video.  I used wires, a bread board, resistors, and the GPIO on the pi to make this work.  I built 2 functions, one for each light, green and red.  You can see in the code below how I imported different modules and in the video how I set it up so each channel corresponded to different channel on the bread board.  I made sure each channel went through a resistor and was grounded to prevent overpowering the LED.  When I tried to repeat this experiment later I ran into a problem because the GPIO were already assigned, so I had to use GPIO.cleanup() to reset the channels at the end.</p><br/>

       <h3>My First Website</h3>

    <p class='indent'>Hi Everyone! Welcome to my first website.  I was able to take an intro to html/css class, and I took what I learned to build this website.  For those of you also new to programming, it is what all websites are coded with.  Although some wrap it up a bow for you to just drag and drop everything into place, but I don't always like the way they work. </p>
    <p class='indent'>When making an html you will need a text editor, such as sublime, which will allow you to save the file as index.html, and a style sheet saves as style.css.  The end .html and .css is the most important part, because it tells the computer the type of file it is reading.  HTML stands for Hyper-Text Mark-up Language, and CSS stands for Cascading Style ¬Sheet.  The more important one to remember is what css stands for, because it is how the computer reads and changes your website.  The computer reads the sheet top to bottom, applying each change as it goes. There are many different ways to use css to select and adjust each piece, and a great way to learn is through a <a href='http://flukeout.github.io/' title='css game'>Css Game.</a>.</p>
    <p class='indent'>There are many great resources for learning the basic setup, and it is one of the simplest languages to learn.  I have found it is a great place to start programming, and you can search online for just about any error message or problem.  Another great way to learn is to take classes, but I understand you may not want to commit to a full boot camp, so sites like meetup.com will help you to find groups that offer 1 or 2 day classes.   There are also some amazing sites that offer free classes online such as <a href='http://www.freecodecamp.com' title='freecodecamp'>freecodecamp.com</a> and <a href='htts://www.codeacademy.com' title=’codeacademy’>codeacademy.com</a>.  Good luck and be sure to check back for more projects! </p>
